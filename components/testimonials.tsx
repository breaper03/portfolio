        I led the Front-End development of an application designed for the integrated management of orders, collections, payments, credits and administration of currencies and bolivars for third parties. I was in charge of designing and implementing new functionalities to optimize the user experience and improve the interface, using React.js, Bootstrap and Axios for an efficient management of HTTP requests.
        In addition, I restructured the internal architecture of the repository, refactoring and optimizing the Front-End code to improve its performance, readability and maintainability. I was also responsible for the deployment and testing of the new features, ensuring their stability and proper functioning.
